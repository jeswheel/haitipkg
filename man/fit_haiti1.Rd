\usage{
fit_haiti1(version = "basic", run_level = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{In c("basic", "basic-full", "joint").}

\item{run_level}{in c(1, 2, 3)}
}
\description{
This function fits the specified version of model 1.
}
\details{
As of Feb 20, 2022, Model 1 can be written in 4 different forms:
\itemize{
\item Basic: aggregated, single time period \code{pomp} object (\code{haiti1()}).
\item Joint: aggregated, joint time periods \code{pomp} object (\code{haiti1_joint()}).
\item Disagg: disaggregated \code{pomp} object (\code{haiti1_disagg()}).
\item Panel: disaggregated \code{panelPomp} object (\code{haiti1_disagg()}).
}

The Basic version is the closest to the model described and used by Lee et al.
in that it only has an additional overdispersion term. Basic-Full is the same
as Basic but fitting through all 430 weeks of data (not split between endemic
and epidemic). We currently provide methods for fitting both the Basic and Joint forms.

m1 <- haiti1_joint()
fit_m1 <- fit_haiti1(version = "joint", run_level = 2)
