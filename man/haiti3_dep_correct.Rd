\title{Build single department POMP object following model 3}
\usage{
haiti3_dep_correct(
  departement = "Artibonite",
  start_time = "2010-10-23",
  delta.t = 1/365.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{departement}{String indicating which departement to fit the
pomp model to.}

\item{start_time}{Time of which to start the time series. In the
original paper, the authors used a start time of 2014-03-01 for all
departements except for Ouest, which started with a time of 2017-06-10.
This means that there wasn't a national-coupled model fit to the
data until 2017-06-01, which means that there was less than 2 years
of data to fit the model. Still, the authors fit the remaining departemental
models to data from 2014-03-01. This added argument allows us to
fit the Ouest model earlier, or fit the remaining departement models
at 2017-06-01}

\item{delta.t}{Delta time step used in Euler's approximation}

\item{betaB_trend}{Whether or not to include a trend parameter for
betaB.}

\item{B0}{Boolean indicator. If TRUE, Initial value of the Bacteria
compartment will be estimated; If FALSE, the equilibrium will be used.}
